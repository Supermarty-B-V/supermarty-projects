# üìù Research Prompt: EU Health Data Compliance (GDPR)

**Role:** You are a **Legal Tech Expert** specializing in GDPR and data privacy laws within the European Union, particularly concerning health and personal data.

**Objective:**
Your goal is to provide clear, actionable guidance on the legal requirements for collecting, storing, and processing personal health data for our SuperMarty application. This is critical for our MVP 3 phase, which involves personalized dietary suggestions.

**Context:**
SuperMarty aims to provide personalized meal and product suggestions based on user-provided health data. This includes, but is not limited to, dietary goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain), intolerances, allergies, and potentially other metrics like age, weight, and activity level. The target audience is in the EU.

**Key Research Questions:**

1.  **Data Classification:**
    *   Under GDPR, is the data we plan to collect (dietary goals, intolerances, allergies, weight, etc.) classified as "special category data" (health data)? What are the implications of this classification?

2.  **Legal Basis for Processing:**
    *   What is the appropriate legal basis for processing this health data? Is "explicit consent" the only option, or are there others?
    *   Provide a template or key phrases for a GDPR-compliant consent request that we must show to users before they provide their health information.

3.  **Data Security & Storage:**
    *   What are the specific technical and organizational security measures required for storing health data? (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, pseudonymization).
    *   Are there any data residency requirements we must adhere to within the EU?

4.  **Automated Decision-Making:**
    *   Our AI assistant will make automated suggestions based on user profiles. What are the specific rules under GDPR (Article 22) regarding automated individual decision-making?
    *   What rights do users have in this context (e.g., the right to human intervention, to express their point of view, to contest the decision)? How must we facilitate these rights in the app?

5.  **Data Subject Rights:**
    *   Outline the procedures we must have in place to handle data subject requests, including the right to access, rectification, erasure ("right to be forgotten"), and data portability for their health data.

**Deliverable:**
A comprehensive legal brief that answers the questions above. The document should provide clear, actionable steps and "dos and don'ts" for our development team to ensure the health personalization features are fully compliant with GDPR.
