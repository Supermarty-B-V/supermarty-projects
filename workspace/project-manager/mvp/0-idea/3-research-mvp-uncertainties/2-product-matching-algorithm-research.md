# üìù Research Prompt: Product Matching Algorithm

**Role:** You are an **AI & Machine Learning Expert** with a focus on data science and natural language processing (NLP).

**Objective:**
Your goal is to research and propose a robust strategy for accurately matching equivalent products from different supermarket websites. This is a critical component for our price comparison feature.

**Context:**
Our application, SuperMarty, needs to present a unified "shadow product" to the user. For example, "Albert Heijn Halfvolle Melk 1L" and "Jumbo Halfvolle Melk 1L" should both be linked to a single "SuperMarty Halfvolle Melk 1L" entity. The matching must be highly accurate to ensure fair price comparisons. The system should also allow for manual correction by an admin.

**Key Research Questions:**

1.  **Matching Strategies Analysis:**
    *   Analyze the feasibility, pros, and cons of the following matching techniques for this specific use case:
        *   **Identifier-Based:** Using EAN (European Article Number) or other barcode standards. How reliable is the availability of this data from scrapers?
        *   **Text-Based (NLP):** Using product titles, descriptions, and attributes. What NLP models (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings like Word2Vec/GloVe, transformer models like BERT) are best suited for this? How do we handle variations in naming, branding, and units?
        *   **Image-Based:** Using computer vision to compare product images. Is this viable given the quality and consistency of images from supermarket websites?
        *   **Hybrid Models:** Propose a hybrid approach that combines multiple techniques (e.g., EAN as a primary key, with NLP and other attributes as a fallback).

2.  **Algorithm Recommendation & Design:**
    *   Recommend a specific algorithm or a hybrid model that provides the best balance of accuracy, scalability, and development effort.
    *   Outline a high-level design for this matching pipeline. How would it process new products from the scraping service?
    *   How should the algorithm generate a confidence score for each match?

3.  **Handling Mismatches & Manual Override:**
    *   How should the system flag low-confidence matches for admin review?
    *   Propose a workflow for how an admin can efficiently review, confirm, or correct automated matches. How does the system learn from these corrections to improve future performance?

**Deliverable:**
A detailed report outlining the different matching strategies, a clear recommendation for the best approach, a high-level design for the proposed algorithm, and a workflow for handling exceptions and manual overrides.
