TRUE,"What are the key factors for end-users to discover bags and meals? For example: price, nutritional value, category, popularity, or user preferences.","If the user has not chosen any filter or preference, show the bags and meals randomly
but other than this, it should be based on the user's preference and the tags that the admin had added to the bags and meals: like Diet, helal, low carb, high protein"
TRUE,"For the matching algorithm:
-Should the system aim for exact matches (same product across all supermarkets)?
-Or should it suggest close matches (similar products with slight differences)?
-How should the system handle scenarios where a product does not exist in one or more supermarkets?","6.1- the admin should be able to change the product of a market if the exact match was not found
6.2- the category should stay the same, but the amounts, weigh, and things like this can be different

TRUE,Vahid: Filter supermarket products with some fields and related them to our product,Amir: It's a good idea but have some challenging products like chilly powder for find in all supermarkets with same filter because same product have some types in different supermarkets and with different prices
TRUE,Vahid: In client side there is a challenge in purchase shopping list in supermarkets,"Amir: It's exist some solution for example in albert heighn can share the shopping list link and other just click on it and use that shopping list
