# ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements: SuperMarty Backend (MVP)

# üß© Actors & Components (Who or what)
*   **System:** The overall backend application.
*   **API:** The interface for the frontend application and admin panel to communicate with the backend.
*   **Database:** Stores all application data (e.g., PostgreSQL).
*   **Admin:** A user with privileges to manage the system's content and users.
*   **Scraping Service:** A Python-based service responsible for data aggregation.
    *   **AlbertHeijn Scraper:** Scrapes product data from Albert Heijn.
    *   **Jumbo Scraper:** Scrapes product data from Jumbo.
    *   **Plus Scraper:** Scrapes product data from Plus.
*   **Supermarket APIs/Websites:** External sources of product data for AH, Jumbo, and Plus.
*   **Scheduled Task Runner (Cron):** Executes periodic tasks, specifically the daily scraping jobs.
*   **Authentication Service:** Manages user and admin authentication (JWT, sessions).
*   **Email Service:** Third-party service (Mailgun) for sending transactional emails (welcome, password reset).

## üåä Activity Flows & Scenarios (What in which order?)
*   **[Automated Product Grouping]**
    *   **Happy Flow:**
        *   GIVEN the scraping service has fetched new products from all supermarkets
        *   WHEN the normalization and grouping process is triggered
        *   AND it identifies two products (e.g., "AH Basic Milk" and "Jumbo Halfvolle Melk") as equivalent based on matching logic
        *   THEN it links both market products to a single system product (e.g., "Halfvolle Melk")
        *   AND the system logs the successful grouping.
    *   **Scenario (Manual Override):**
        *   GIVEN an admin is viewing a system product with incorrectly matched market products
        *   WHEN the admin unlinks an incorrect market product
        *   AND searches for and links the correct market product
        *   THEN the system product's grouping is updated
        *   AND this manual override is preserved during subsequent automated runs.
    *   **Mermaid Diagram:**
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            A[Start Grouping] --> B{Find Equivalent Products};
            B -->|Match Found| C[Link Market Products to System Product];
            B -->|No Match| D[Create New System Product];
            C --> E[Admin Reviews Grouping];
            E -->|Correct| F[No Action];
            E -->|Incorrect| G[Admin Manually Adjusts Links];
        ```

# üõ†Ô∏è Behaviours (How does it act when.. in terms of.. ?)
*   **API**
    *   [Should enforce JWT authentication for all protected endpoints.]
    *   [Should validate all incoming data and return consistent error responses.]
    *   [Should support pagination for all list endpoints to ensure performance.]
*   **Scraping Service**
    *   [Should run automatically on a daily schedule via a cron job.]
    *   [Should respect `robots.txt` and implement reasonable delays to avoid being blocked.]
    *   [Should log errors for failed scrapes and send an alert to an administrator.]
*   **Database**
    *   [Should use foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.]
    *   [Should have a regular backup and monitoring policy configured.]

# üí° Ideas & ü™µ Backlog
*   [Integrate with Picnic supermarket API.]
*   [Implement automated scraping for recipes from supermarket websites.]
*   [Develop an AI Food Assistant for personalized recommendations (post-MVP).]
*   [Epic 9: Develop a "Data Broker" service for trend analysis.]
*   [Implement advanced user roles and permissions for end-users (e.g., trainer/client hierarchy).]
*   [Implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to improve API performance.]

# ‚ùì Questions
*   What is the exact logic for the initial automated product matching? Is it based on name similarity, EAN/barcode, or a combination?
*   For nutritional values on products sold by piece (e.g., avocado), what is the standard weight to use for calculation?
*   What are the specific requirements for the "low-code" admin panel? Does this imply a specific technology (e.g., Retool, Appsmith) or just a goal for rapid development?
*   What are the non-functional requirements regarding performance (e.g., response times, concurrent users) for the MVP?
