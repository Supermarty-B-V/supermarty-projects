## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1. Vision
To become the leading intelligent grocery shopping assistant in the EU, helping users save money, eat healthier, and simplify their meal planning through a seamless, AI-driven experience.

### 1.2. Proposal Overview
This document outlines a revised, comprehensive 7-month phased development plan to bring the SuperMarty vision to market. The previous plan has been updated to a more granular, de-risked 5-phase MVP approach that prioritizes rapid validation and incremental replacement of the existing technical landscape.

This new strategy begins with a prototyping phase (MVP-0) to validate the user experience, followed by a Flutter app release that leverages the existing backend (MVP-1). Subsequent phases will systematically replace the backend with a modern Supabase and custom scraping solution (MVP-2), replace the admin dashboard with Retool (MVP-3), and finally integrate the core SuperMarty AI features (MVP-4).

This proposal provides a detailed breakdown of features for each MVP phase, required resources, timeline, and estimated costs to deliver the full MVP scope, totaling **1,520 hours** at an estimated cost of **â‚¬152,000**.

## 2. Strategic Approach & Recommendations

### 2.1. Phased MVP Rollout
To manage risk, accelerate time-to-market, and deliver value incrementally, the project will be executed in five distinct MVP phases:

* **MVP-0: Full Prototype with Mock Data:** A rapid, low-cost phase to build a high-fidelity, interactive prototype. This allows for early user testing and UI/UX validation before committing to full-stack development.
* **MVP-1: Flutter App with Existing Backend:** Develop the full Flutter application connecting to the existing backend provided by the other party. This de-couples frontend and backend development, allowing for parallel progress and getting a native app into users' hands quickly.
* **MVP-2: Supabase Backend & Scraping Solution:** A strategic replacement of the other party's backend with our own scalable Supabase infrastructure and proprietary scraping solution. This gives us full control over our data, performance, and feature development velocity.
* **MVP-3: Retool Dashboard:** Replace the existing Laravel dashboard with a more flexible and rapidly developed Retool dashboard for internal data management and operations.
* **MVP-4: SuperMarty AI Integration:** Integrate the core AI-powered personalization features, delivering on the primary "health-first" value proposition.

### 2.2. Technology Stack
* **Frontend:** Flutter for a single codebase across Web, iOS, and Android.
* **Backend:** Supabase for its integrated database, authentication, and serverless functions, augmented by a custom Python service for scraping and matching.
* **Admin Panel:** Retool for rapid development of internal data management dashboards.
* **AI & Matching:** Python services using Sentence-BERT for NLP matching and integrating with a third-party LLM for the AI assistant.

## 7. Key Decisions & Justifications

* **Phased Replacement Strategy:** This approach de-risks the project significantly. By first building the Flutter app against the existing backend (MVP-1), we can make immediate progress on the user-facing product without being blocked by a full backend rebuild. This allows for earlier user testing and feedback, while the complex backend replacement (MVP-2) happens in a subsequent, dedicated phase.
* **Proprietary Data Backend (MVP-2):** While connecting to the existing backend is a good first step, owning our data pipeline is critical for long-term success. Research shows that building a custom, hybrid solution provides the most flexibility and avoids vendor lock-in, making MVP-2 a strategic necessity.
* **Retool for Admin Panel (MVP-3):** Using a low-code platform like Retool for the internal dashboard allows for extremely rapid development and iteration, freeing up core engineering resources to focus on the consumer-facing product and complex backend services.

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

* **Risk:** The existing backend API is poorly documented or unstable, delaying MVP-1.
  * **Mitigation:** Allocate specific time for API discovery in MVP-1. Build an anti-corruption layer in the Flutter app to isolate it from the legacy API, easing the transition to Supabase in MVP-2.
* **Risk:** Web scraping proves more difficult or legally challenging than anticipated.
  * **Mitigation:** The scraping service in MVP-2 will be built modularly, prioritizing mobile APIs and using web scraping as a fallback, as recommended by research.
* **Risk:** GDPR compliance for health data (MVP-4) is complex and requires specialized legal knowledge.
  * **Mitigation:** Allocate specific hours for compliance work and legal review. Design the architecture with privacy-by-design principles, including EU-only data residency and encryption from the start.

## 9. Next Steps

1. **Formal Approval:** Seek stakeholder approval for this revised 5-phase proposal, timeline, and budget.
2. **Initiate MVP Phase 0:** Begin UI/UX design and prototype development immediately.
3. **Team Allocation:** Formally allocate the project team resources as outlined in this proposal.
4. **Kick-off Meeting:** Schedule a project kick-off to align the team on the goals and timeline for MVP-0.
