# ðŸ“š Collection of Routes & Views: SuperMarty Application

> This document contains a collection of all planned routes and views for the SuperMarty MVP. The purpose is to create a centralized map of the application's structure for developers, defining the scope of frontend navigation and API routing.

**Purpose of this Collection:** To serve as a single source of truth for all navigational paths within the user-facing application and the internal admin panel. This ensures alignment between frontend routing and backend API endpoint design.

### Notes

*   **User-Facing App:** The primary application is built with Flutter to target Web, iOS, and Android. The routing will be handled by a Flutter navigation package.
*   **Admin Panel:** The admin panel will be built using Retool, a low-code platform. The "routes" represent different pages or views within the Retool application.
