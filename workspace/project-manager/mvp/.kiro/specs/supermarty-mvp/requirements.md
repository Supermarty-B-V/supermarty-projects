# SuperMarty MVP Lovable Prototype Requirements Document

## Introduction

SuperMarty is an intelligent grocery shopping assistant designed to help users in the EU save money and eat healthier through AI-driven price comparison and personalized meal planning. This prototype will be built exclusively using Lovable to create a complete mobile app experience that demonstrates the full user journey and interface design with realistic mock data.

This prototype focuses on creating a comprehensive user experience using mock data for all static content (products, prices, recipes, AI responses) and local storage for user-generated content (shopping bags, favorites, preferences, user profiles). The goal is to build a fully functional prototype that provides the complete SuperMarty experience without requiring any backend infrastructure, allowing stakeholders to experience and validate the product concept, user interface design, and user flows before proceeding with full development.

The prototype will simulate the complete SuperMarty ecosystem including price comparison across Dutch supermarkets (Albert Heijn, Jumbo, Plus), meal planning with recipe integration, personalized AI dietary recommendations, and a comprehensive shopping experience - all powered by carefully crafted mock data and local browser storage.

**Key Prototype Characteristics:**
- Built entirely in Lovable using React/TypeScript
- Mobile-first responsive design optimized for smartphone usage
- All product data, prices, and content are realistic mock data
- User-generated content (shopping bags, favorites, profiles) stored in browser localStorage
- Complete user experience simulation without external API dependencies
- Dutch language interface with realistic Dutch grocery products
- Comprehensive design system demonstrating the full SuperMarty brand experience
