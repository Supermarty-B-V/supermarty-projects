# Software Audit Master Strategy

## Audit Purpose
This document serves as the master reference for conducting a comprehensive software audit of three applications (frontend web app, admin panel, and backend) developed by Bugloos for the MVP release. The audit focuses on four primary aspects as requested by the client:

1. **Quality Assessment** (Kwaliteitscheck)
2. **Deliverables Verification** (Gedaan wat ze zouden doen)
3. **Architecture Evaluation** (Architectuur)
4. **Time Registration Validation** (Uren klopt)

## MVP Focus
This audit specifically targets the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) release of the application suite. The methodology distinguishes between:

- **MVP Scope (Minimum Required Checks)**: Essential evaluations needed before the MVP release
- **Full Vision Scope (Ideal Checks)**: Comprehensive evaluations that go beyond the essential MVP requirements

The audit approach prioritizes the minimum required checks while accommodating more thorough assessment where time and resources permit.

## Audit Methodology

### Phase 1: Information Gathering
1. **Document Collection**
   - Obtain all project documentation (requirements, specifications, etc.)
   - Access source code repositories for all three applications
   - Retrieve complete time tracking records
   - Collect technical documentation (architecture, APIs, etc.)

2. **Stakeholder Interviews**
   - Project managers
   - Development team members
   - Client representatives
   - Quality assurance personnel

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Analysis

#### Quality Assessment
- Conduct static code analysis
- Evaluate code against best practices
- Assess test coverage and effectiveness
- Review error handling and security implementation
- Evaluate performance optimization techniques

#### Deliverables Verification
- Create traceability matrix of requirements to implementations
- Verify feature completeness against specifications, focusing on 'Must-Have' features for MVP
- Identify any gaps between promised and delivered functionality
- Evaluate change request handling

#### Architecture Evaluation
- Analyze component structure and organization
- Evaluate technology stack appropriateness
- Assess scalability and maintainability for MVP launch and near-term usage
- Review integration approaches and patterns
- Evaluate security architecture

#### Time Registration Validation
- Compare time records against delivered work
- Analyze distribution of hours across project components
- Identify discrepancies between effort and output
- Evaluate project management effectiveness
- Correlate git commit history with reported hours

### Phase 3: Findings Documentation & Recommendations
- Compile comprehensive audit report
- Present key findings with supporting evidence
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Deliver executive summary for stakeholders
- Evaluate against established success criteria
