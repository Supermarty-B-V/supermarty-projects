# Audit Success Criteria

This document outlines the specific criteria by which the success of the software audit will be measured. These criteria serve as both guidance for the audit team and a framework for evaluating the completeness and effectiveness of the audit process.

## Overall Success Measures

The success of this audit project will be measured by:

1. **Timely Completion:** Delivery of all audit components by the agreed target dates
2. **Comprehensiveness:** Complete coverage of all four primary audit focus areas
3. **Actionable Insights:** Provision of clear, prioritized recommendations
4. **Evidence-Based Assessment:** All findings supported by concrete evidence
5. **Client Acknowledgement:** Confirmation from the client that the audit provides the necessary objective information to meet their overall goals

## Focus-Area Specific Success Criteria

### 1. Quality Assessment (Kwaliteitscheck)

#### Minimum Success Requirements:
- Identification and clear reporting of all Critical/High severity functional bugs impacting core MVP functionality
- Basic security assessment against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in critical modules
- Assessment of code maintainability using standard metrics
- Verification of the existence and basic functionality of automated tests

#### Full Success Requirements:
- Comprehensive evaluation of code quality across all modules
- In-depth security testing and vulnerability assessment
- Thorough code coverage assessment
- Detailed coding standards review
- Complete reporting of bugs at all severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

### 2. Deliverables Verification (Gedaan wat ze zouden doen)

#### Minimum Success Requirements:
- Verification of the implementation and basic functionality of all features marked as 'Must-Have' in the MVP section of the roadmap
- Cross-reference of delivered features against available requirements documentation
- Confirmation that core user flows are functional

#### Full Success Requirements:
- Verification of all features (including 'Should-Have' and 'Could-Have' items)
- Detailed validation against functional and non-functional requirements
- Comprehensive assessment of all user flows and edge cases

### 3. Architecture Evaluation (Architectuur)

#### Minimum Success Requirements:
- Assessment of the suitability of the current architecture for MVP launch
- Identification of any immediate showstopper scalability or security risks
- Evaluation of basic component separation (Frontend App, Admin Panel, Backend)
- Assessment of adherence to fundamental architectural principles

#### Full Success Requirements:
- Long-term scalability and maintainability assessment
- Detailed evaluation of design patterns and architectural choices
- Comprehensive analysis of deployment architecture and CI/CD processes
- In-depth security architecture review

### 4. Time Reporting Validation (Uren klopt)

#### Minimum Success Requirements:
- Sample-based verification of reported development hours against objective evidence
- Identification and quantification of any significant discrepancies (>15-20%)
- Verification of consistent time logging processes

#### Full Success Requirements:
- Comprehensive verification of time tracking across the entire project
- Detailed time-per-feature analysis
- Cross-verification against multiple data sources (git commits, Jira, deliverables)

## Documentation Success Criteria

- **Final Report Clarity:** The final report must be clear, concise, and accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- **Evidence Documentation:** All findings must be supported by specific, documented evidence
- **Recommendation Practicality:** Recommendations must be practical, prioritized, and actionable
- **Risk Assessment:** Risks must be clearly identified and categorized by severity and potential impact

## Validation Process

The audit will be considered successful when:

1. The audit team has completed all minimum required checks for each focus area
2. The final report addresses all objectives defined in the project brief
3. All identified critical/high-severity issues are clearly documented with supporting evidence
4. The client formally acknowledges that the report provides the objective information needed
5. All deliverables have been provided according to the agreed timeline
