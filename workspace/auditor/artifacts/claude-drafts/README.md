# Software Audit Methodology

This directory contains a comprehensive set of documents and templates for conducting a software audit of the three applications (frontend web app, admin panel, and backend) developed by Bugloos for the MVP release.

## Core Audit Focus Areas

The audit focuses on four primary aspects as requested by the client:

1. **Quality Assessment** (Kwaliteitscheck)
2. **Deliverables Verification** (Gedaan wat ze zouden doen)
3. **Architecture Evaluation** (Architectuur)
4. **Time Registration Validation** (Uren klopt)

## MVP vs. Full Vision Scope

This audit methodology addresses two levels of scope:

- **MVP Scope (Minimum Required Checks)**: Essential evaluations needed for the pre-release quality check of the MVP, focusing on critical functionality, basic security, core features verification, immediate architectural risks, and sample time tracking validation.

- **Full Vision Scope (Ideal Checks)**: Comprehensive evaluations that go beyond the MVP essentials, including in-depth maintainability analysis, verification of all features (including "Should/Could" have), long-term architecture assessment, and more thorough time tracking verification.
