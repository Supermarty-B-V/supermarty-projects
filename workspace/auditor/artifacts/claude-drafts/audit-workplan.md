# Software Audit Workplan

## 1. Audit Scope & Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Perform a quality assessment of three applications (frontend web app, admin panel, backend)
- Verify deliverables match contractual agreements
- Evaluate architectural decisions and implementation
- Validate time registration against delivered work

### Key Questions
- Does the delivered software meet quality standards?
- Were all promised features and functionalities delivered?
- Is the architecture well-designed, maintainable, and scalable?
- Do the reported hours align with the scope of work delivered?

## 2. Information Gathering

### Documents to Request
- Complete source code repositories for all three applications
- Technical documentation including:
  - System architecture diagrams
  - API documentation
  - Database schemas
  - Deployment configurations
- Requirements specifications and user stories
- Project timeline with milestones and deliverables
- Complete time registration records with task descriptions
- Test plans, test results, and QA processes
- Deployment procedures and environments configuration

### Stakeholder Interviews
- Project manager(s)
- Lead developers (frontend, backend)
- QA/testing personnel
- Client-side project owners

## 3. Technical Audit Methodology

### Code Review
