# Risk Assessment Framework

## Purpose
This framework provides a structured approach to identify, assess, and prioritize potential risks in the audited applications, helping to focus the audit on areas of highest concern.

## Risk Rating Matrix

| Impact | Likelihood | Risk Level |
|--------|------------|------------|
| High   | High       | Critical   |
| High   | Medium     | High       |
| High   | Low        | Medium     |
| Medium | High       | High       |
| Medium | Medium     | Medium     |
| Medium | Low        | Low        |
| Low    | High       | Medium     |
| Low    | Medium     | Low        |
| Low    | Low        | Very Low   |

## Risk Categories

### Technical Debt
- Inconsistent coding patterns
- Outdated dependencies
- Lack of automated tests
- Incomplete documentation
- Code duplication
- Complex, hard-to-maintain code sections

### Security Vulnerabilities
- Authentication weaknesses
- Authorization flaws
- Input validation issues
- Data protection concerns
- Third-party dependency vulnerabilities
- Insecure API endpoints

### Performance Issues
- Inefficient database queries
- Unoptimized front-end assets
- Memory leaks
- Excessive API calls
- Inadequate caching
- Poor load handling

### Scalability Limitations
- Architectural bottlenecks
- Database design constraints
- Stateful design that limits horizontal scaling
- Resource-intensive operations
- Lack of asynchronous processing

### Maintainability Concerns
- Poor code organization
- Inadequate documentation
- Complex business logic implementation
- Tightly coupled components
- Inconsistent error handling
- Lack of logging and monitoring

## Risk Identification Process

1. **Initial Scanning**: Automated tools to identify common issues
2. **Manual Code Review**: Expert review focusing on critical components
3. **Architecture Analysis**: Evaluation of system design against best practices
4. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Gathering insights on known pain points
5. **Historical Issue Analysis**: Review of past bugs and incidents
