# Software Audit Plan

## Audit Overview

### Purpose
To conduct a comprehensive quality and compliance audit of the development work performed by Social.Market, focusing on a set of three applications: frontend web app, admin panel, and backend services.

### Audit Objectives
1. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate the overall quality of the delivered software
2. **Scope Verification**: Confirm that all promised deliverables were completed as specified
3. **Architectural Review**: Assess the soundness and appropriateness of the technical architecture
4. **Time Registration Validation**: Verify that the hours reported align with the work delivered

## Audit Methodology

### 1. Documentation Review
- **Project Requirements**: Original project specifications and requirements
- **Technical Documentation**: Architecture diagrams, API documentation, user guides
- **Time Records**: Detailed breakdown of hours spent by category and task
- **Project Management Artifacts**: Sprint plans, tickets, milestone records

### 2. Codebase Analysis
- **Static Code Analysis**: Using automated tools to assess code quality
- **Manual Code Review**: Expert assessment of selected critical components
- **Architecture Review**: Evaluation of system design patterns and component relationships
- **Security Assessment**: Identification of potential security vulnerabilities
- **Performance Review**: Assessment of application efficiency and responsiveness

### 3. Application Testing
- **Functionality Testing**: Verification that all features work as expected
- **Integration Testing**: Assessment of component interactions
- **User Experience Review**: Evaluation of usability and interface design
- **Cross-browser/platform Testing**: Verification of compatibility

### 4. Time Registration Analysis
- **Task-to-Time Mapping**: Analysis of time spent versus deliverables
- **Industry Benchmarks Comparison**: Assessment against typical development timeframes
- **Complexity-to-Effort Ratio**: Evaluation of time spent relative to task complexity

## Audit Deliverables

1. **Executive Summary**: High-level overview of findings and recommendations
2. **Quality Assessment Report**: Detailed analysis of code quality and best practices compliance
3. **Scope Completion Analysis**: Verification of delivered features against requirements
4. **Architectural Assessment**: Evaluation of technical design decisions and implementation
5. **Time Registration Validation**: Analysis of reported hours versus actual work completed
6. **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for improvements or remediation
