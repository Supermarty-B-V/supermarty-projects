# Next Steps for Audit Execution

## Immediate Actions

1. **Access Source Code Repositories**
   - Request repository access for frontend web app
   - Request repository access for admin panel
   - Request repository access for backend services
   - Configure local development environments

2. **Obtain Complete Project Documentation**
   - Request original project requirements specification
   - Request functional specifications
   - Request technical design documents
   - Request any available architecture diagrams
   - Request API documentation

3. **Acquire Time Tracking Details**
   - Request detailed time tracking records
   - Request project planning documents
   - Request sprint documentation
   - Request any change request records

4. **Schedule Key Stakeholder Interviews**
   - Project manager(s)
   - Lead developers (frontend, backend)
   - QA responsible personnel
   - Client representatives

## Critical Questions to Address

### Project Scope & Requirements
- What were the original project requirements and success criteria?
- Were there changes to requirements during development?
- How were change requests handled and documented?
- What was the official definition of "done" for features?

### Architecture & Technical Decisions
- What was the rationale behind the selected technology stack?
- How were architectural decisions documented and communicated?
- What standards and patterns were established for development?
- What security and performance considerations were implemented?

### Development Process
- What was the development methodology (Agile, Waterfall, hybrid)?
- How was quality assurance integrated into the development process?
- What testing strategies were employed?
- How were deployment and release processes managed?

### Time Registration
- What was the time tracking methodology used?
- How were tasks estimated and assigned?
- Were there significant deviations from estimates?
- How were overtime or additional resources handled?

## Technical Environment Setup

1. **Development Environment**
   - Set up local development environment for all three applications
   - Configure necessary databases and services
   - Ensure test data is available

2. **Analysis Tools Preparation**
   - Prepare static code analysis tools appropriate for the stack
   - Set up code quality metrics collection
   - Configure documentation generation tools if needed

3. **Reporting Framework**
