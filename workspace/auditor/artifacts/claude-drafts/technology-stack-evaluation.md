# Technology Stack Evaluation Guide

## Purpose
This guide outlines the methodology for evaluating the appropriateness, implementation, and performance of the technology stack used across the three applications.

## Technology Inventory Analysis

### Frontend Web Application
- JavaScript/TypeScript framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)
- State management libraries
- UI component libraries
- CSS frameworks/methodologies
- Build tools and bundlers
- Testing frameworks
- Client-side routing
- API client libraries
- Authentication libraries
- Data visualization tools

### Admin Panel
- Framework relationship to main frontend
- Shared libraries with main frontend
- Admin-specific UI components
- Permission/role management libraries
- Batch operation tools
- Data export/import utilities
- Dashboard frameworks

### Backend Services
- Programming language(s)
- Web framework(s)
- Database technology(s)
- ORM/data access layers
- Authentication/authorization frameworks
- API specification tools
- Caching mechanisms
- Background job processing
- File storage solutions
- Logging/monitoring tools
- Containerization technologies

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technology Selection Appropriateness
