**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** \[Date Created - e.g., 2024-05-01]
**Author:** \[Your Name/Audit Team Name]

## 1. Background & Context

This document outlines the project brief for a software audit commissioned by \[Client Name] concerning the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) release of a software suite developed by Bugloos. The suite comprises a Frontend Web Application, a Frontend Admin Panel, and a Backend system.

The primary triggers for this audit are:

*   **Upcoming MVP Release:** The audit serves as a crucial pre-release quality check.
*   **End-of-Project Acceptance:** The findings will contribute to the formal acceptance process for the delivered MVP.
*   **Objective Assessment Need:** An objective assessment is required to inform potential future decisions regarding the client-developer relationship.

No major known issues have been pre-identified; the audit will perform an objective assessment based on the defined scope.

## 2. Audit Objectives

The overall goals of this audit are to:

*   **Gain Confidence:** Provide \[Client Name] with assurance regarding the MVP's quality, stability, and readiness for release.
*   **Obtain Decision Support:** Deliver objective, evidence-based data to inform potential decisions regarding the engagement with Bugloos.
*   **Mitigate Risk:** Identify critical quality, security, or architectural issues requiring immediate attention before the MVP launch.

Specific objectives are defined across four key areas:

**2.1. Kwaliteitscheck (Quality Check):**

*   Identify and classify functional bugs by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low), focusing on those impacting core MVP functionality.
*   Assess code maintainability using standard metrics (e.g., Cyclomatic Complexity, Maintainability Index, Code Coverage) against industry best practices.
*   Verify application security against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10) through code review and potentially scanning tools.

**2.2. Gedaan wat ze zouden doen (Scope Adherence):**

*   Verify the implementation and basic functionality of all features marked as 'Must-Have' in the `sm-audit-roadmap-2024.md` MVP section.
*   Cross-reference delivered features against available requirements documentation (pending receipt: Source Code, Documentation, Designs/Mockups, Jira access, other relevant documents).
*   *Note:* The lack of formally defined DoD/Acceptance Criteria will require establishing reasonable assumptions based on standard practices or further clarification if possible.

**2.3. Architectuur properly set up (Architecture Assessment):**

*   Assess the suitability and robustness of the current architecture (Frontend App, Admin Panel, Backend) to support the MVP launch and expected near-term usage (e.g., first 6 months).
*   Evaluate adherence to fundamental architectural principles (e.g., separation of concerns, modularity).
*   Identify any significant architectural bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities inherent in the design.

**2.4. Uren klopt with what they said (Time Reporting Accuracy):**

*   Following best practices, cross-verify reported development hours against objective evidence (e.g., task completion data in Jira, code commit history, deliverables) for a representative sample period.
*   Identify and quantify any significant discrepancies (e.g., >15-20% variance) between logged hours and verifiable work output.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Primary Audience:** \[Client Name] (including key decision-makers like CTO, Project Manager, relevant business leads).
*   **Secondary Audience:** Bugloos (including their Project Manager, Development Lead, potentially developers).

*Note:* The report will present evidence-based findings objectively, suitable for both audiences.

## 4. Scope

**4.1. Audit "MVP" Scope (Minimum Required Checks):**

The following checks are essential for the audit to be minimally successful before the software MVP release:

*   **Quality:**
    *   Identify and report all Critical/High severity functional bugs impacting core MVP features.
    *   Basic security scan for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in critical modules.
    *   Quick assessment of code readability/consistency in a sample of core modules.
    *   Verification that basic automated tests (e.g., unit tests) exist and pass.
    *   Basic scalability assessment for core functionality under expected MVP load.
*   **Scope Adherence:**
    *   Verify presence and basic functionality of 'Must-Have' features from `sm-audit-roadmap-2024.md`.
    *   Check general alignment with available high-level documentation.
    *   Confirm core user flows are functional.
*   **Architecture:**
    *   Identify immediate showstopper scalability or security risks for launch.
    *   Basic assessment of component separation (Frontend App, Admin, Backend).
*   **Time Reporting:**
    *   Perform a sample check (e.g., last 2 sprints/1 month) comparing logged hours vs. evidence.
    *   Report significant discrepancies (>15-20%).
    *   Verify consistent time logging process during the sampled period.

**4.2. Audit "Full Vision" Scope (Ideal/Nice-to-Have Checks):**

If time and resources permit, the audit ideally includes:

*   **Quality:** Comprehensive maintainability analysis (metrics), in-depth security testing (pen testing, SAST/DAST), code coverage assessment, coding standards review, Medium/Low bug reporting.
*   **Scope Adherence:** Verification of 'Should/Could' features, detailed checks against specs, non-functional requirement checks.
*   **Architecture:** Long-term scalability/maintainability assessment, refactoring recommendations, design pattern evaluation, deployment/CI/CD assessment.
*   **Time Reporting:** 100% verification (or larger sample), time-per-feature analysis, team interviews.

**4.3. Audit Exclusions (Explicitly Out of Scope):**

*   Third-party software/integrations not developed by Bugloos.
*   In-depth performance load testing or stress testing.
*   Formal User Acceptance Testing (UAT) execution.
*   Usability testing or detailed UX/UI design review beyond basic functionality.
*   Assessment of the development *process* itself beyond its impact on deliverables.
*   Hardware infrastructure review beyond direct application impact.
*   Financial audit beyond verifying development hours.
*   Legal or contractual compliance review (unless specified as a security/data requirement).
