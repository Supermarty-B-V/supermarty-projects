**Subject: Request for Information and Access - Supermarty B.V. / Supermarty MVP Audit**

Dear \[Bugloos Contact Person Name],

Hope you are doing well.

As you know, we are initiating a software audit for the MVP phase of the Supermarty (Frontend Web App, Admin Panel, and Backend) developed by Bugloos. To facilitate this process efficiently, we kindly request your assistance in providing the following information and system access as soon as possible (ASAP).

Our goal is to cover the key areas discussed: Quality Check, Scope Adherence, Architecture Assessment, and Time Reporting Accuracy.

**Requested Items:**

**1\. Quality Check:**

*   **Source Code Repositories:** Access (e.g., read-only user) to the Git repositories for the Frontend Web App, Admin Panel, and Backend (including relevant branches/tags for the MVP).
*   **Bug Tracking System:** General access (e.g., read-only user) to the Jira project(s) used for tracking issues related to this project.
*   **Automated Testing:** Access to any reports or results from automated tests (unit, integration, etc.) and code coverage analysis, if available.
*   **Coding Standards:** Any documented coding standards or guidelines followed during development.
*   **Static Analysis Results:** Access to results from any static code analysis tools used (e.g., SonarQube reports), if available.

**2\. Scope Adherence:**

*   **Requirements Documentation:** The final agreed-upon requirements documentation (e.g., PRD, user stories, feature lists or other definitive documents).
*   **Design Documents:** Final versions of design documents, wireframes, or mockups used for the MVP development.
*   **Application Environments:** Access details (URLs, read-only credentials if possible) for relevant testing or staging environments displaying the MVP state of the Frontend Web App, Admin Panel, and Backend.

**3\. Architecture Assessment:**

*   **Architecture Diagrams:** Any available system overview, component, or deployment diagrams.
*   **Technical Design Documents:** Documents explaining key architectural decisions or the overall technical design.
*   **Technology Stack Information:** Confirmation or documentation of the specific technologies and versions used for each application component.
*   **Deployment Information:** Deployment scripts or infrastructure-as-code files (e.g., Dockerfiles, configuration files), if applicable and available.

**4\. Time Reporting Accuracy:**

*   **Timesheet Data:** Access to the time tracking system or exported timesheet reports covering the MVP development period.
*   **Project Management Data:** Access to the project management tool (e.g., Jira, the mentioned Excel sheet) showing tasks, estimates, and logged time corresponding to the timesheets for the MVP scope.

**Access Format:**

For system access (Git, Jira, application environments), providing dedicated read-only accounts for the audit team would be ideal where feasible. For documents, direct file sharing (e.g., via Google Drive, email) is suitable. Please let us know ifÂ´ a different approach is more convenient for you.

We understand gathering this information may take some effort and appreciate your cooperation in providing it as soon as possible to keep the audit process on track.

If you have any questions regarding these requests, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,

Amir
