Subject: Re: Infrastructure Proposal for supermarty.nl Launch

Hi [Bugloos Contact Person Name],

Thanks for sending over the infrastructure proposal and for your work in getting us ready for launch. I've reviewed it and have a few thoughts and questions to ensure we set things up in the most optimal way.

**Server & Storage:**
I agree that a VM for a 3-month evaluation period is a sensible approach for the early stages.
Regarding the Leaseweb VM, the 100GB storage is often included in their standard VPS packages (like the VPS02_1 plan). Could you please clarify if a separate support ticket for this 100GB is still necessary, or if it's part of the VM plan you suggested?

I'm also familiar with TransIP and have had positive experiences with their service, particularly their 24/7 support, which I value. Would you be open to considering a comparable VM from TransIP as an alternative to Leaseweb? We can compare the offerings to ensure we get the best fit.

**SSL Certificates:**
For SSL, I'd prefer to use Let's Encrypt for both the backend and frontend. It provides strong, trusted encryption, can be automated, and comes at no cost, which is ideal for this stage. A 1-year plan for paid certificates might be an unnecessary commitment right now.

**Domain (supermarty.nl):**
Regarding the `supermarty.nl` domain, I prefer to maintain direct control over the domain registrar account for security and administrative reasons. Therefore, I won't be able to share the domain management credentials.
Instead, please provide a list of all the specific DNS records (e.g., A, CNAME, MX, TXT records) that you'll need for the application to function correctly. I can then configure these records myself through the registrar (which is indeed TransIP).

**Mail Provider:**
Mailgun is a good suggestion for transactional emails. For the initial launch phase, their free tier (which allows around 100 emails per day) should be sufficient for our needs. We can easily upgrade to a paid plan as our email volume increases.

I believe these adjustments will help us launch with a flexible, secure, and cost-effective infrastructure. I'm happy to discuss any of these points further.

Thanks again for your recommendations.

Kind Regards,

Amir
